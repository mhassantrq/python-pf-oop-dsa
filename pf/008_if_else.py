"""
Conditional Structure: If else

These are used to control the flow of the code execution.

lets see basic example of how this works below
"""

num1, num2 = 5, 6

if num1 < num2:
    print('Num1 is greater')
    #   any thing written under if statement with indentation is part of the body of if statement
else:
    print('Num2 is greater')

"""
Above is a simple example of use of if and else.

unlike some other progamming languages, python does not use curly brackets for declaring body of if and else.
python uses indentation for this purpose. as can be seen in above example of if.

if can work alone without else as well.
