Relational operators in Python

There are total six relational operators which include:

    >       greater than
    <       less than
    >=      greater than or equal to
    <=      less than or equal to
    ==      equal to
    !=      not equal to

these operators require two operands, 
    left side operator right side
and it returns either true or false.
