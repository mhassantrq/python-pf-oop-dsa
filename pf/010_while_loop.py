"""
Similar to for loop, while loop is used to iterate and run the same piece of code multiple times.

while loop is run until a specific condition is not false.
"""


i = 0 # initial value of i set to 0

while i<= 10: # loop runs while i is less than or equal to 10
    print(i)
    i += 1 # increment value of i with +1 in every iteration

"""
the above loop will run until i reaches 10
i starts at value 0. with every iteration, i is incremented by +1. so loop will run total 11 times. for i=0, i=1 and until i=10.
